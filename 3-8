command-line argument
example of command-line argument is -o when we run clang we can change the output to a file of my choice name.
Literally, type the command after the line, and on a line, and it's an argument in the sense of input to an argument.

argc == argument count
argv == argument vector == array of argument

return 1; // equivelent to exit
        // if all was well, you would return 0, it means good, don't have problem.
        // However, if something went wrong, return 1, to keep it simple. you could return 2 billion or something

return 1 is a signal to a computer, this program did not suceed.

In argv, first type word you type, the program name is stored in argv[0].
The second word you type, the first argument you cared about, is an argv[1].
if you print argv[0], you get ./exit .
