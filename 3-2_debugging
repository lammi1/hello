we can use help50 when code has syntax error.
put help50 infront of make file.
(in the cs50 sandbox.)

But, in logical errors, we can use printf to see the each step.
However, when we use CS50 IDE we can use debug50. (intergreated development environment = visual studio, eclipse, net beans..)
we put debug50 infront of ./file
when we click left of the space where number of line is, it creates red dot which is similar to stop sign.
This is called break point.
It stops on the red point, and when we click step over, it allows user step through my code step by step.
